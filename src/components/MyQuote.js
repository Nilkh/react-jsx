// 1. Define a component to render your quote






























/*
--- Part 2: Components Attributes ---

Start the development server to see the rendered UI in your browser. That way you can see your progress being rendered in the browser window as you work.

- Define an object, above the component, called `quote` with two properties: title and src.

- Assign a string to the title property, something like "My Chosen Quote".

- Assign a valid image URL to the src property, representing an image related to the quote.

- Save the changes to MyQuote.js.

- In the MyQuote component, Wrap the content of your reaturn statment with a <div></div> to insure one outmost elemnt.

- Nest an <h1> element inside of your <div> element.

- Use the value of quote.title as the content of the <h1> element.

- Still inside of the <div></div> tags, make a new line after the <h1></h1> tags.

- On your new line, add an <img /> element.

Your <img /> should have two attributes:

  1. an `src` of quote.src
  2. an `alt` of quote.title

Save the changes to MyQuote.js.
